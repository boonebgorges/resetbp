Usage:
./resetbp.sh [databasename]

You'll have to replace the username/pw to your local mysql installation.

This is a crappy script I use to wipe out a local BuddyPress installation so that I can test installation more quickly. It destroys the BP and bbPress tables, deletes BP options, and switches the theme back to Twenty Ten so that you don't get a white screen.

This script sucks and I am not responsible for any damage you do to you, your WP installation, or the well being of your loved ones in using it.
